 Installation Names
 ==================
 
-By default, `make install' installs the package's commands under
-`/usr/local/bin', include files under `/usr/local/include', etc.  You
-can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving
-`configure' the option `--prefix=PREFIX'.

+options like '--bindir=DIR' to specify different values for particular
+kinds of files.  Run 'configure --help' for a list of the directories
+you can set and what kinds of files go in them.  In general, the default
+for these options is expressed in terms of '${prefix}', so that
+specifying just '--prefix' will affect all of the other directory
+specifications that were not explicitly provided.
+
+   The most portable way to affect installation locations is to pass the
+correct locations to 'configure'; however, many packages provide one or
+both of the following shortcuts of passing variable assignments to the
+'make install' command line to change installation locations without
+having to reconfigure or recompile.
+
+   The first method involves providing an override variable for each
+affected directory.  For example, 'make install
+prefix=/alternate/directory' will choose an alternate location for all
+directory configuration variables that were expressed in terms of
+'${prefix}'.  Any directories that were specified during 'configure',
+but not in terms of '${prefix}', must each be overridden at install time
+for the entire installation to be relocated.  The approach of makefile
+variable overrides for each directory variable is required by the GNU
+Coding Standards, and ideally causes no recompilation.  However, some
+platforms have known limitations with the semantics of shared libraries
+that end up requiring recompilation when using this method, particularly
+noticeable in packages that use GNU Libtool.
+
+   The second method involves providing the 'DESTDIR' variable.  For
+example, 'make install DESTDIR=/alternate/directory' will prepend
+'/alternate/directory' before all installation names.  The approach of
+'DESTDIR' overrides is not required by the GNU Coding Standards, and
+does not work on platforms that have drive letters.  On the other hand,
+it does better at avoiding recompilation issues, and works well even
+when some directory options were not specified in terms of '${prefix}'
+at 'configure' time.
 
 Optional Features
 =================
 
-Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
-`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
-They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE

+you can use the 'configure' options '--x-includes=DIR' and

+
+   Some packages offer the ability to configure how verbose the
+execution of 'make' will be.  For these packages, running './configure
+--enable-silent-rules' sets the default to minimal output, which can be
+overridden with 'make V=1'; while running './configure
+--disable-silent-rules' sets the default to verbose, which can be
+overridden with 'make V=0'.
+
+Particular systems
+==================
+
+   On HP-UX, the default C compiler is not ANSI C compatible.  If GNU CC
+is not installed, it is recommended to use the following options in
+order to use an ANSI C compiler:
+
+     ./configure CC="cc -Ae -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=500"
+
+and if that doesn't work, install pre-built binaries of GCC for HP-UX.
+
+   HP-UX 'make' updates targets which have the same time stamps as their
+prerequisites, which makes it generally unusable when shipped generated
+files such as 'configure' are involved.  Use GNU 'make' instead.
+
+   On OSF/1 a.k.a. Tru64, some versions of the default C compiler cannot
+parse its '<wchar.h>' header file.  The option '-nodtk' can be used as a
+workaround.  If GNU CC is not installed, it is therefore recommended to
+try
+
+     ./configure CC="cc"
+
+and if that doesn't work, try
+
+     ./configure CC="cc -nodtk"
+
+   On Solaris, don't put '/usr/ucb' early in your 'PATH'.  This
+directory contains several dysfunctional programs; working variants of
+these programs are available in '/usr/bin'.  So, if you need '/usr/ucb'
+in your 'PATH', put it _after_ '/usr/bin'.
+
+   On Haiku, software installed for all users goes in '/boot/common',
+not '/usr/local'.  It is recommended to use the following options:
+
+     ./configure --prefix=/boot/common
 
 Specifying the System Type
 ==========================
 
-There may be some features `configure' cannot figure out automatically,
-but needs to determine by the type of machine the package will run on.
-Usually, assuming the package is built to be run on the _same_
-architectures, `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints a
-message saying it cannot guess the machine type, give it the
-`--build=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
-type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name which has the form:

+#   ACX_PTHREAD([ACTION-IF-FOUND[, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND]])
+#
+# DESCRIPTION
+#
+#   This macro figures out how to build C programs using POSIX threads. It
+#   sets the PTHREAD_LIBS output variable to the threads library and linker
+#   flags, and the PTHREAD_CFLAGS output variable to any special C compiler
+#   flags that are needed. (The user can also force certain compiler
+#   flags/libs to be tested by setting these environment variables.)
+#
+#   Also sets PTHREAD_CC to any special C compiler that is needed for
+#   multi-threaded programs (defaults to the value of CC otherwise). (This
+#   is necessary on AIX to use the special cc_r compiler alias.)
+#
+#   NOTE: You are assumed to not only compile your program with these flags,
+#   but also link it with them as well. e.g. you should link with
+#   $PTHREAD_CC $CFLAGS $PTHREAD_CFLAGS $LDFLAGS ... $PTHREAD_LIBS $LIBS
+#
+#   If you are only building threads programs, you may wish to use these
+#   variables in your default LIBS, CFLAGS, and CC:
+#
+#          LIBS="$PTHREAD_LIBS $LIBS"
+#          CFLAGS="$CFLAGS $PTHREAD_CFLAGS"
+#          CC="$PTHREAD_CC"
+#
+#   In addition, if the PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE thread-attribute constant
+#   has a nonstandard name, defines PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE to that name
+#   (e.g. PTHREAD_CREATE_UNDETACHED on AIX).
+#
+#   ACTION-IF-FOUND is a list of shell commands to run if a threads library
+#   is found, and ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND is a list of commands to run it if it
+#   is not found. If ACTION-IF-FOUND is not specified, the default action
+#   will define HAVE_PTHREAD.
+#
+#   Please let the authors know if this macro fails on any platform, or if
+#   you have any other suggestions or comments. This macro was based on work
+#   by SGJ on autoconf scripts for FFTW (http://www.fftw.org/) (with help
+#   from M. Frigo), as well as ac_pthread and hb_pthread macros posted by
+#   Alejandro Forero Cuervo to the autoconf macro repository. We are also
+#   grateful for the helpful feedback of numerous users.

+# In the past libtool.m4 has provided macros via AC_DEFUN (or AU_DEFUN),
+# which have later been changed to m4_define as they aren't part of the
+# exported API, or moved to Autoconf or Automake where they belong.
+#
+# The trouble is, aclocal is a bit thick.  It'll see the old AC_DEFUN
+# in /usr/share/aclocal/libtool.m4 and remember it, then when it sees us
+# using a macro with the same name in our local m4/libtool.m4 it'll
+# pull the old libtool.m4 in (it doesn't see our shiny new m4_define
+# and doesn't know about Autoconf macros at all.)

+# So we provide this file, which has a silly filename so it's always
+# included after everything else.  This provides aclocal with the
+# AC_DEFUNs it wants, but when m4 processes it, it doesn't do anything
+# because those macros already exist, or will be overwritten later.
+# We use AC_DEFUN over AU_DEFUN for compatibility with aclocal-1.6.
+#
+# Anytime we withdraw an AC_DEFUN or AU_DEFUN, remember to add it here.
+# Yes, that means every name once taken will need to remain here until

-   * thus won't be added until you flush the connection, and if there's an error
-   * adding the match (only possible error is lack of resources in the bus), you
-   * won't find out about it.
-   *
-   * Normal API conventions would have the function return a boolean value
-   * indicating whether the error was set, but that would require blocking always
-   * to determine the return value.
-   *
-   * The AddMatch method is fully documented in the D-Bus specification. For
-   * quick reference, the format of the match rules is discussed here, but the
-   * specification is the canonical version of this information.
-   *
-   * Rules are specified as a string of comma separated key/value pairs. An
-   * example is "type='signal',sender='org.freedesktop.DBus',
-   * interface='org.freedesktop.DBus',member='Foo', path='/bar/foo',destination=':452345.34'"
-   *
-   * Possible keys you can match on are type, sender, interface, member, path,
-   * destination and numbered keys to match message args (keys are 'arg0', 'arg1', etc.).
-   * Omitting a key from the rule indicates a wildcard match. For instance omitting
-   * the member from a match rule but adding a sender would let all messages from
-   * that sender through regardless of the member.
-   *
-   * Matches are inclusive not exclusive so as long as one rule matches the
-   * message will get through. It is important to note this because every time a
-   * essage is received the application will be paged into memory to process it.
-   * This can cause performance problems such as draining batteries on embedded platforms.
-   *
-   * If you match message args ('arg0', 'arg1', and so forth) only string arguments
-   * will match. That is, arg0='5' means match the string "5" not the integer 5.
-   *
-   * Currently there is no way to match against non-string arguments.

-   * specify the interface. If a message omits the interface, then it will NOT

-   * method calls should not usually give an interface.
-   *
-   * However, signal messages are required to include the interface so when

-   *

+## ------ ##
+## Usage. ##
+## ------ ##
+
+# This file is a library for parsing options in your shell scripts along
+# with assorted other useful supporting features that you can make use
+# of too.
+#
+# For the simplest scripts you might need only:
+#
+#   #!/bin/sh
+#   . relative/path/to/funclib.sh
+#   . relative/path/to/options-parser
+#   scriptversion=1.0
+#   func_options ${1+"$@"}
+#   eval set dummy "$func_options_result"; shift
+#   ...rest of your script...
+#
+# In order for the '--version' option to work, you will need to have a
+# suitably formatted comment like the one at the top of this file
+# starting with '# Written by ' and ending with '# warranty; '.
+#
+# For '-h' and '--help' to work, you will also need a one line
+# description of your script's purpose in a comment directly above the
+# '# Written by ' line, like the one at the top of this file.
+#
+# The default options also support '--debug', which will turn on shell
+# execution tracing (see the comment above debug_cmd below for another
+# use), and '--verbose' and the func_verbose function to allow your script
+# to display verbose messages only when your user has specified
+# '--verbose'.
+#
+# After sourcing this file, you can plug processing for additional
+# options by amending the variables from the 'Configuration' section
+# below, and following the instructions in the 'Option parsing'
+# section further down.
+
+## -------------- ##
+## Configuration. ##
+## -------------- ##
+
+# You should override these variables in your script after sourcing this
+# file so that they reflect the customisations you have added to the
+# option parser.
+
+# The usage line for option parsing errors and the start of '-h' and
+# '--help' output messages. You can embed shell variables for delayed
+# expansion at the time the message is displayed, but you will need to
+# quote other shell meta-characters carefully to prevent them being
+# expanded when the contents are evaled.

+# override it after sourcing this library to reflect the full set of
